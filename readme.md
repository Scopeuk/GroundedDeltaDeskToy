#Assembly instructions
1). Place bearings into the big hole on the bottom of each shoulder
2). Assemble an arm by pressing two segments together (peg into hole) the "spare" peg should be under the arm (nothing sticks out from the side of the arm)
3). add the wrist peg into the hole on the top arm, note the wrist will sit above the other arm section, if the wrist would be upside down rotate the arm 180 degrees
4). Connect the arm to the shoulder, note orientation, one side of the bracket is right on the centre of the round part, this is the side the arm should attach from
5). Repeat this for the other two arms
6). Sit each arm on top of one of the pegs on the base


# Known Problems
* The tolerance on the bearings is a little loose, the first version has a small piece of electrical tape over each pen and on the edge of each bearing to tighten it up
* The printed joints are not very good, new design to follow at some point
